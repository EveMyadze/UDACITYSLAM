# UDACITYSLAM
I performed landmark detection and robot tracking by implementing SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping). The SLAM function coded in this project takes in motion and sensor data as input to output the data visualized in the map below.  The purple xâ€™s denote landmark positions, the red circle denotes the final position of the robot.
